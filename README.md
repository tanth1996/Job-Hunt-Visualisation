# Job-Hunt-Visualisation
## Personal project to take a look at how my job hunt from Dec 2019 - Feb 2020 as a fresh graduate went down

### Take-aways from job-hunting as a fresh graduate:
1. Patience is key and the (heavily biased) data spells it out - a successful job application can easily take up to 2 months if not more (excluding preparation prior to sending out applications), and most of that time will be spent waiting.
2. Waiting isn't all that bad... okay it can get pretty bad but there's no shortage of ways to improve or enrich yourself within that time (like turning your job hunt into a data exploration project).
3. Sadly, a very considerable proportion of job applications sent (13 out of 29) did not get a real reply/follow-up.
4. Personally, I had postive experiences with just about every company that reached out to me by phone call. Nothing wrong with letting virtual assessments/interviews automate away a good chunk of the work (5 out of 13 companies that responded used online assessments - the most popular method in my limited experience), but throwing an actual human voice into the mix sooner rather than later seems to help.
5. More personal bias, but I feel like getting a job as a fresh grad is just really random. That doesn't mean it's super difficult to get a job, but the job you end up in will probably be pretty different from what you envisioned at the start (by no means a bad thing). The offer I ended up taking was one of the most recent ones I applied for (which BTW is amazing that the entire process only took 22 days; look at the data, it was insanely quick), and if I wasn't lucky enough to have another offer, I could have easily waited for another month to end my job hunt. But we don't get to control chance, we get to control how much we improve ourselves, and staying vigilant for new opportunities. Bottom line - stay calm, and keep on keeping on.
6. Finally, I'm constantly reminded of how fortunate I am to be surrounded by a supportive family. All my successes are theirs.

So that's that. Take the data with a grain of salt, 29 points of data is not much; anecdotal evidence at best but it was still fun to see my own personal experiences reflected in the data. I'm very lucky to end my job hunt in just 54 days, but the real work I reckon will be from here on out :^)
