# Job-Hunt-Visualisation
## Personal project to take a look at how my job hunt from Dec 2019 - Feb 2020 as a fresh graduate went down

### Take-aways from job-hunting as a fresh graduate:
1. Patience is key and the (heavily biased) data spells it out - a successful job application can easily take up to 2 months if not more (excluding preparation prior to sending out applications), and most of that time will be spent waiting.
2. Waiting isn't all that bad... okay it can get pretty bad but there's no shortage of ways to improve or enrich yourself within that time (like turning your job hunt into a data exploration project).
3. Sadly, a very considerable proportion of job applications sent (13 out of 29) did not get a real reply/follow-up.
4. Personally, I had postive experiences with just about every company that reached out to me by phone call. Nothing wrong with letting virtual assessments and interviews automate away a good chunk of the work, but throwing an actual human voice into the mix sooner rather than later seems to help.
5. More personal bias, but these days I feel like getting a job as a fresh grad is just really random, and that's probably because getting a chance at a job is literally that - chance. The offer I ended up taking was one of the most recent ones I applied for (which btw is amazing that the entire process only took 22 days; very fast comparatively), and if I wasn't sitting on another offer, I could have easily waited for another month to end my job hunt. But we don't get to control chance, we get to control how much we improve ourselves as a person, and staying vigilant for new opportunities. Bottom line - stay calm, and keep on keeping on.
6. Finally, I'm constantly reminded of how fortunate I am to be surrounded by a supportive family. All my successes are theirs.
