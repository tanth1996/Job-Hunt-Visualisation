# Job-Hunt-Visualisation
## Personal project to take a look at how my job hunt from Dec 2019 - Feb 2020 as a fresh graduate went down

### Here's the data:

### Take-aways from job-hunting as a fresh graduate:
1. Patience is key - a successful job application can easily take up to 2 months if not more (excluding preparation prior to sending out applications), and most of that time will be spent waiting.
2. Waiting isn't all that bad... okay it can get pretty bad but there's no shortage of ways to enrich yourself in that time (like turning your job hunt into a data exploration project).
3. Sadly, a significant proportion of job applications sent (13 out of 29 or 44.83%) did not get a real reply/follow-up.
4. Personally, I had positive experiences with almost every company that reached out to me by phone. The most popular recruitment method I saw was online assessments - 5 out of 13 companies that moved my applications forward sent me one (followed by virtual and phone interviews). I myself am a proponent of automation, but throwing an actual human voice into the mix sooner rather than later really augments the success of the recruitment process IMO.
5. More personal bias, but I think getting a job as a fresh grad is pretty random. That doesn't mean it's super difficult to get a job, but the job you get will likely be different from what you envisioned at the start (which is by no means a bad thing). The offer I ended up taking was literally one of the last ones I applied for (which BTW is amazing that the entire process only took 22 days; look at the data, it was very quick). We don't get to control 'chance', but we can boost OUR chances by improving ourselves, and staying vigilant for new opportunities. Bottom line - stay calm, and keep on keeping on.
6. Finally, I'm constantly reminded of how fortunate I am to be surrounded by a supportive family. All my successes are theirs.

So that's that. Take the data with a grain of salt; 29 points of data is not much and my own biases are definitely reflected in the data. Anecdotal evidence at best but it was still fun to see my own personal experiences reflected in the data. I'm lucky to end my job hunt in just 54 days, but the real work I reckon will be from here on out :^)
